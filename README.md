# Project Name

**Author**: Nicole and Ken
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application uses servers to store the article data and load the information onto the page, rather than using local storage like we were previously or a locally hosted file.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
In order to get this project running, the user must create all the files necessary, as well as install node.js and initialize it, as well as downloading the postgres package as a dependency onto their computer.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
In this app, we use HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Handlebars.js, packages from node called express and postgres, and a psql server.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples: -->

## Credits and Collaborations
